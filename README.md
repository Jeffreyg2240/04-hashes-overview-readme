# Hashes

## Objectives

We're going to introduce a new data structure, one that is more complicated than arrays. Hashes will occupy us for the next several lessons and there's a lot to cover. This lesson, which includes code challenges, covers the following:

1. Introduction: what are hashes and what do we need them for?
2. Creating Hashes
3. Retrieval Data from Hashes
4. Adding Data to Hashes

In the upcoming lessons, we'll go over how to iterate over and manipulate hashes and how to build more complex, or nested, hashes. 

## Introduction
> Hashes are a lot like arrays: they have a bunch of slots that can point to various objects. However, in an array, the slots are lined up in a row, and each one is numbered (starting from zero). In a hash, the slots aren’t in a row (they are just sort of jumbled together) and you can use any object to refer to a slot, not just a number.

Up until this point, we've stored our data in list-form using arrays. Let's take a look at an example where an array would not be sufficient to meet our storage needs.

## Hash Structure

Hashes are structured with keys and values. Each key/value pair makes up one unit in the hash. The entire collection of key/value pairs, which are comma separated, is enclosed in curly braces, `{ }`. 

```ruby
hash = {"key" => "value", "another_key" => "another value"}
```

You can think of a hash as a dictionary. The key is the reference point that is set equal to an associated value. In fact, a dictionary makes a pretty good hash example. Let's take a look: 

```ruby
dictionary = {

  "apple" => "a delicious fruit", 
  "this readme" => "wonderful and informative piece of reading", 
  "Moby Dick" => "a novel by my good friend, Herman Melville"
  
}
```
Keys in hashes can be strings, symbols or integers. They are set equal to their associated values via the hash-rocket, `=>`.  

### Example: Named Data

You can think of the data stored in a hash as being *associative*. In other words, keys point to data that is *related* to that key. Let's take a look at the following example: 

```ruby
the_rock = {"name" => "Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson", "weight" => "a lot"}
```

If we tried to represent this same information as an array, it would look something like this: 

```ruby
the_rock = ["name", "Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson", "weight", "a lot"]
```

Then, in order to access The Rock's name, we would have to use the following line of code: 

```ruby
the_rock[1]
```

That requires us to remember, every time we want to access The Rock's name, that it is stored at the first index of `the_rock` array. That is too hard to keep track of. 

Unlike arrays which store data in numbered indexes, hashes store data in unique keys––like an address. **Each key in a hash must be unique**. The value associated with that key is then accessed via the key name, instead of an index number. Let's take a look: 

```ruby
the_rock = {"name" => "Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson", "weight" => "a lot"}

the_rock["name"]
#  => "Dwayne, The Rock, Johnson"
```

### What is a Hash Key?

A key in a hash can be a string, a symbol or an integer, as long as you only use each key once. If, for example, we broke this cardinal rule with the following hash: 


```ruby
the_rock = {"name" => "Dwayne Johnson", "name" => "The Rock", "weight" => "a lot"}
```

And then tried to access The Rock's name: 

```ruby
the_rock["name"]
```

It will return the value of the *second* `"name"` key. There is no way to specify *which* name key we want, since hash look-ups operate based on keys. Therefore, **we must use unique keys to catalogue values**. 


### Example: Customs Inspector

![Herman Melville](http://flatiron-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/160px-Herman_Melville.jpg)

The year is 1866 and we work beside [Herman Melville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville) (author of Moby Dick) as a customs inspector in New York. (I know, when did our lives become so old-timey and exciting? FYI he really did work there in 1866.) We're in charge of inspecting an incoming shipment and we need to track the items we're inspecting by listing each type of item (for example whale bone corset, porcelain, oil painting, other old fashioned item, etc) and the number of that item in the shipment. 

Let's say our shipment contains 5 whale bone corsets, 2 porcelain vases and 3 oil paintings. If we tried to store them in an array in list form, it would look like this: 

```ruby
old_fashioned_things = ["whale bone corset", "porcelain vase", "oil painting"
```
As it stands, there is no way for us to include the count of each item in a way that associates the item to it's count. That's no good. How is our co-worker Herman Melville going to be able to tell how many of each item are in this shipment? 

Here's where a hash can come in handy. With a hash, we can store a list of associated pairs. In other words, we can store the pairs of item/count. Let's take a look: 

```ruby
old_fashioned_things = {
  "whale bone corset" => 5, 
  "porcelain vase" => 2, 
  "oil painting" => 3
}
``` 

## Creating Hashes

We can make a new hash via the class constructor or the literal constructor, just like arrays. 

### The Class Constructor

```ruby
my_hash = Hash.new
  => {}  
```

### The Literal Constructor

```ruby
my_hash = {}
  => {}
```

Initializing a hash that already contains data is a lot like initiating an array with data. We use the literal constructor:

```ruby
pets = {:cat => "Maru", :dog => "Pluto"}
  => {:cat => "Maru", :dog => "Pluto"}
```
In the upcoming lab, you'll get a chance to practice making your own hashes.

## Retrieving Data from Hashes

Retrieving data is similar to retrieving data from an array but instead of giving the index number in brackets, you give the name of the key. If an array is a list in which we access index items by their number, a hash is a dictionary in which we access values by their key. 

```ruby
pets = {:cat => "Maru", :dog => "Pluto"}

pets[:cat]
  => "Maru"
```
This is referred to as the `[]` method. 

## Adding Objects to Hashes

Adding items to hashes is easy. Instead of  `<<` shovel method that we use to item objects to arrays, hashes use an `[:key]=` method to add data. Let's say we're busy plugging away at our shipping manifest when Herman Melville comes running up to use to say we overlooked some items in our inspection. In fact, there are also 10 jars of molasses that we need to add to the shipping manifest. We would achieve that with the following code:

```ruby
shipping_manifest = {
  "whale bone corset" => 5, 
  "porcelain vase" => 2, 
  "oil painting" => 3
}

shipping_manifest["jars of molasses"] = 10

puts shipping_manifest
#  └── shipping_manifest = {
  "whale bone corset" => 5, 
  "porcelain vase" => 2, 
  "oil painting" => 3, 
  "jars of molasses" => 10
}
```

To add data, you call the name of the hash, followed by a beginning bracket, followed by the name of the new key, followed by a closing bracket, followed by the assignment operator (`=`), followed by the name of the new value. This is referred to as the `[]=` method.
